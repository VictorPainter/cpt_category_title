# Custom Post Type Taxonomy Term Retriever

This PHP script retrieves the terms (categories or tags) associated with a custom post type in WordPress. It is specifically built to extract and display the terms from a custom taxonomy named `therapist_category`.

## Usage

The script is used to fetch and display terms (such as categories) associated with a custom post type in WordPress. The retrieved terms are then displayed as a space-separated string.

### Code Breakdown

1. **Retrieve the terms**: 
   - The `get_the_terms()` function is used to retrieve terms associated with the current post and a specific taxonomy (`therapist_category`).
   
2. **Check for errors**:
   - The script checks if terms were successfully retrieved and ensures there are no errors by using `!empty()` and `!is_wp_error()`.

3. **Extract term names**:
   - It uses `wp_list_pluck()` to easily extract the names of the terms from the returned array.

4. **Join the terms**:
   - The term names are concatenated into a single string using `implode()` with a space delimiter.

5. **Output the term names**:
   - The terms are output using `echo` and are sanitized with `esc_html()` to ensure they are safely displayed.

### Requirements

- WordPress 5.x or higher
- PHP 7.0 or higher

### Example Output

If the custom post is categorized under the terms "Therapist", "Counseling", and "Wellness", the script will output:

### Security Note

The use of `esc_html()` ensures that the output is safely displayed on the front-end, preventing potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Installation
